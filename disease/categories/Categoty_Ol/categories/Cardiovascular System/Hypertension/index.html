                    <h1> Overview </h1><br><br>
                    <h2> What is lower back hypertension?</h2><br>
                    <p>Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). In general, hypertension is a blood pressure reading of 130/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) or higher.</p>
                    <p>The American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association divide blood pressure into four general categories. Ideal blood pressure is categorized as normal.</p>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Normal blood pressure. </span> Blood pressure is lower than 120/80 mm Hg.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Elevated blood pressure. </span> The top number ranges from 120 to 129 mm Hg and the bottom number is below, not above, 80 mm Hg.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Stage 1 hypertension. </span> The top number ranges from 130 to 139 mm Hg or the bottom number is between 80 and 89 mm Hg.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Stage 2 hypertension. </span> The top number is 140 mm Hg or higher or the bottom number is 90 mm Hg or higher.</li>
                    <p>Blood pressure higher than 180/120 mm Hg is considered a hypertensive emergency or crisis. Seek emergency medical help for anyone with these blood pressure numbers.</p>
                    <p>Untreated, high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack, stroke and other serious health problems. It's important to have your blood pressure checked at least every two years starting at age 18. Some people need more-frequent checks.</p>
                    <p>Healthy lifestyle habits —such as not smoking, exercising and eating well — can help prevent and treat high blood pressure. Some people need medicine to treat high blood pressure.</p>

                    <h2>How common is lower back pain?</h2><br>
                    <p>Around four out of five people have lower back pain at some point in their lives. It’s one of the most common reasons people visit healthcare providers.</p>
                    <p>Some people are more likely to have lower back pain than others. Risk factors for lower back pain include:</p>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Age: </span> People over 30 have more back pain. Disks (soft, rubbery tissue that cushions the bones in the spine) wear away with age. As the disks weaken and wear down, pain and stiffness can result.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Weight: </span> People who have overweight/obesity or carry extra weight are more likely to have back pain. Excess weight puts pressure on joints and disks.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Overall health: </span> Weakened abdominal muscles can’t support the spine, which can lead to back strains and sprains. People who smoke, drink alcohol excessively or live a sedentary lifestyle have a higher risk of back pain.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Occupation and lifestyle: </span> Jobs and activities that require heavy lifting or bending can increase the risk of a back injury.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Structural problems: </span> Severe back pain can result from conditions, such as scoliosis, that change spine alignment.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Disease: </span> People who have a family history of osteoarthritis, certain types of cancer and other disease have a higher risk of low back pain.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Mental health: </span> Back pain can result from depression and anxiety. </li>

                        <h2>What are the symptoms of hypertension?</h2><br>
                        <p>Most people with high blood pressure have no symptoms, even if blood pressure readings reach dangerously high levels. You can have high blood pressure for years without any symptoms.</p>
                        <p>A few people with high blood pressure may have:</p>
                        <li> Headaches</li>
                        <li> Shortness of breath</li>
                        <li> Nosebleeds</li>
                        <p>However, these symptoms aren't specific. They usually don't occur until high blood pressure has reached a severe or life-threatening stage.</p>

                        <h2>What causes hypertension?</h2><br>
                        <p>Blood pressure is determined by two things: the amount of blood the heart pumps and how hard it is for the blood to move through the arteries. The more blood the heart pumps and the narrower the arteries, the higher the blood pressure.</p>
                        <p>There are two main types of high blood pressure.</p>
                        <li>Primary hypertension, also called essential hypertension</li>
                        <p>For most adults, there's no identifiable cause of high blood pressure. This type of high blood pressure is called primary hypertension or essential hypertension. It tends to develop gradually over many years. Plaque buildup in the arteries, called atherosclerosis, increases the risk of high blood pressure.</p>
                        <li>Secondary hypertension</li>
                        <p>This type of high blood pressure is caused by an underlying condition. It tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than does primary hypertension. Conditions and medicines that can lead to secondary hypertension include:</p>

                        <li> Adrenal gland tumors</li>
                        <li> Blood vessel problems present at birth, also called congenital heart defects</li>
                        <li> Cough and cold medicines, some pain relievers, birth control pills, and other prescription drugs</li>
                        <li> Illegal drugs, such as cocaine and amphetamines</li>
                        <li> Kidney disease</li>
                        <li> Obstructive sleep apnea</li>
                        <li> Thyroid problems</li>

                        <p>Sometimes just getting a health checkup causes blood pressure to increase. This is called white coat hypertension.</p>

                        <h1> Diagnosis and Tests</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>How is hypertension diagnosed?</h2><br>
                        <p>To diagnose high blood pressure, your health care provider examines you and asks questions about your medical history and any symptoms. Your provider listens to your heart using a device called a stethoscope.</p>
                        <p>Your blood pressure is checked using a cuff, usually placed around your arm. It's important that the cuff fits. If it's too big or too small, blood pressure readings can vary. The cuff is inflated using a small hand pump or a machine.</p>
                        <p>If you are diagnosed with high blood pressure, your provider may recommend tests to check for a cause.</p>
                        <li><span>Ambulatory monitoring.</span> A longer blood pressure monitoring test may be done to check blood pressure at regular times over six or 24 hours. This is called ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. However, the devices used for the test aren't available in all medical centers. Check with your insurer to see if ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is a covered service.</li>
                        <li><span>Lab tests.</span> Blood and urine tests are done to check for conditions that can cause or worsen high blood pressure. For example, tests are done to check your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. You may also have lab tests to check your kidney, liver and thyroid function.</li>
                        <li><span>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG).</span> This quick and painless test measures the heart's electrical activity. It can tell how fast or how slow the heart is beating. During an electrocardiogram (ECG), sensors called electrodes are attached to the chest and sometimes to the arms or legs. Wires connect the sensors to a machine, which prints or displays results.</li>
                        <li><span>Echocardiogram. </span> This noninvasive exam uses sound waves to create detailed images of the beating heart. It shows how blood moves through the heart and heart valves.</li>

                        <h2>What are the treatments for hypertension?</h2><br>
                        <p>Medicines used to treat high blood pressure include:</p>
                        <li> Eating a heart-healthy diet with less salt</li>
                        <li>Getting regular physical activity
                            t</li>
                        <li> Maintaining a healthy weight or losing weight</li>
                        <li> Limiting alcohol</li>
                        <li> Not smoking</li>
                        <li> Eating a heart-healthy diet with less salt</li>
                        <li> <span> Water pills (diuretics).</span> These drugs help remove sodium and water from the body. They are often the first medicines used to treat high blood pressure. There are different classes of diuretics, including thiazide, loop and potassium sparing. Which one your provider recommends depends on your blood pressure measurements and other health conditions, such as kidney disease or heart failure. Diuretics commonly used to treat blood pressure include chlorthalidone, hydrochlorothiazide (Microzide) and others.</li>
                        <li> <span> Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.</span> These drugs help relax blood vessels. They block the formation of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. Examples include lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), benazepril (Lotensin), captopril and others.</li>
                        <li> <span> Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). </span> These drugs also relax blood vessels. They block the action, not the formation, of a natural chemical that narrows blood vessels. angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) include candesartan (Atacand), losartan (Cozaar) and others.</li>
                        <li> <span> Calcium channel blockers.</span> These drugs help relax the muscles of the blood vessels. Some slow your heart rate. They include amlodipine (Norvasc), diltiazem (Cardizem, Tiazac, others) and others. Calcium channel blockers may work better for older people and Black people than do angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors alone.</li>

                        <h1>Prevention</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>Can I prevent hypertension?</h2><br>
                        <p>A commitment to a healthy lifestyle can help prevent and manage high blood pressure. Try these heart-healthy strategies:</p>
                        <li> <span> Eat healthy foods.  </span>Eat a healthy diet. Try the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet. Choose fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish and low-fat dairy foods. Get plenty of potassium from natural sources, which can help lower blood pressure. Eat less saturated fat and trans fat.                        </li>
                        <li> <span> Use less salt. </span>Processed meats, canned foods, commercial soups, frozen dinners and certain breads can be hidden sources of salt. Check food labels for the sodium content. Limit foods and beverages that are high in sodium. A sodium intake of 1,500 mg a day or less is considered ideal for most adults. But ask your provider what's best for you.</li>
                        <li> <span> Limit alcohol.  </span>Even if you're healthy, alcohol can raise your blood pressure. If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women, and up to two drinks a day for men. One drink equals 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of 80-proof liquor.</li>
                        <li> <span> Don't smoke.  </span>Tobacco injures blood vessel walls and speeds up the process of hardening of the arteries. If you smoke, ask your care provider for strategies to help you quit.</li>
                        <li> <span> Maintain a healthy weight.  </span> If you're overweight or have obesity, losing weight can help control blood pressure and lower the risk of complications. Ask your health care provider what weight is best for you. In general, blood pressure drops by about 1 mm Hg with every 2.2 pounds (1 kilogram) of weight lost. In people with high blood pressure, the drop in blood pressure may be even more significant per kilogram of weight lost.</li>
                        <li> <span> Get more exercise.  </span> Regular exercise keeps the body healthy. It can lower blood pressure, ease stress, manage weight and reduce the risk of chronic health conditions. Aim to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes a week of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of the two.</li>
                        <li> <span> Practice good sleep habits.</span>Poor sleep may increase the risk of heart disease and other chronic conditions. Adults should aim to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep daily. Kids often need more. Go to bed and wake at the same time every day, including on weekends. If you have trouble sleeping, talk to your provider about strategies that might help.</li>
                        <li> <span> Manage stress.</span>Find ways to help reduce emotional stress. Getting more exercise, practicing mindfulness and connecting with others in support groups are some ways to reduce stress.</li>
                        <li> <span> Try slow, deep breathing.</span>Practice taking deep, slow breaths to help relax. Some research shows that slow, paced breathing (5 to 7 deep breaths per minute) combined with mindfulness techniques can reduce blood pressure. There are devices available to promote slow, deep breathing. According to the American Heart Association, device-guided breathing may be a reasonable nondrug option for lowering blood pressure. It may be an good option if you have anxiety with high blood pressure or can't tolerate standard treatments.</li>

                        <h1>Outlook / Prognosis</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>What is the outlook for people with lower back pain?</h2><br>
                        <p>The outlook depends on the cause of pain. Most people with back strains and sprains recover and do not have long-term health issues. But many people will have another episode within a year.</p>
                        <p>Some people have chronic back pain that doesn’t get better after several weeks. Older people with degenerative conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis may have symptoms that get worse over time. Surgery and other treatments are effective at helping people with a range of injuries and conditions live pain-free.</p>

                        <p>Lower back pain usually gets better with rest and pain relievers. Back pain that doesn’t go away may be a sign of a more serious condition.
                        See your provider if you have:</p>
                        <li>Pain that doesn’t get better after about a week of at-home care.</li>
                        <li>Tingling, numbness, weakness or pain in your buttocks or legs.</li>
                        <li>Severe pain or muscle spasms that interfere with your normal activities.</li>
                        <li>Fever, weight loss, bowel or bladder problems or other unexplained symptoms.</li>
