                    <p>Heart failure occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. When this happens, blood often backs up and fluid can build up in the lungs, causing shortness of breath.</p>
                    <p>Certain heart conditions gradually leave the heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump blood properly. These conditions include narrowed arteries in the heart and high blood pressure.</p>
                    <p>Proper treatment may improve the symptoms of heart failure and may help some people live longer. Lifestyle changes can improve quality of life. Try to lose weight, exercise, use less salt and manage stress.</p>
                    <p>But heart failure can be life-threatening. People with heart failure may have severe symptoms. Some may need a heart transplant or a device to help the heart pump blood.</p>
                    <p>Heart failure is sometimes called congestive heart failure. </p>

                    <h2>How common is lower back pain?</h2><br>
                    <p>Around four out of five people have lower back pain at some point in their lives. It’s one of the most common reasons people visit healthcare providers.</p>
                    <p>Some people are more likely to have lower back pain than others. Risk factors for lower back pain include:</p>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Age: </span> People over 30 have more back pain. Disks (soft, rubbery tissue that cushions the bones in the spine) wear away with age. As the disks weaken and wear down, pain and stiffness can result.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Weight: </span> People who have overweight/obesity or carry extra weight are more likely to have back pain. Excess weight puts pressure on joints and disks.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Overall health: </span> Weakened abdominal muscles can’t support the spine, which can lead to back strains and sprains. People who smoke, drink alcohol excessively or live a sedentary lifestyle have a higher risk of back pain.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Occupation and lifestyle: </span> Jobs and activities that require heavy lifting or bending can increase the risk of a back injury.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Structural problems: </span> Severe back pain can result from conditions, such as scoliosis, that change spine alignment.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Disease: </span> People who have a family history of osteoarthritis, certain types of cancer and other disease have a higher risk of low back pain.</li>
                    <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Mental health: </span> Back pain can result from depression and anxiety. </li>

                        <h2>What are the symptoms of heart failure?</h2><br>
                        <p>If you have heart failure, your heart can't supply enough blood to meet your body's needs.</p>
                        <p>Symptoms may develop slowly. Sometimes, heart failure symptoms start suddenly. Heart failure symptoms may include:</p>
                        <p>Other symptoms of lower back pain include:</p>
                        <li> Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down.</li>
                        <li> Fatigue and weakness.</li>
                        <li> Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet.</li>
                        <li> Rapid or irregular heartbeat.</li>
                        <li> Reduced ability to exercise.</li>
                        <li> Wheezing.</li>
                        <li> A cough that doesn't go away or a cough that brings up white or pink mucus with spots of blood.</li>
                        <li> Swelling of the belly area.</li>
                        <li> Very rapid weight gain from fluid buildup. </li>
                        <li> Nausea and lack of appetite.</li>
                        <li> Difficulty concentrating or decreased alertness.</li>
                        <li> Chest pain if heart failure is caused by a heart attack.</li>

                        <h2>What causes heart failure?</h2><br>
                        <p>Heart failure can be caused by a weakened, damaged or stiff heart.</p>
                        <li>If the heart is damaged or weakened, the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger. The heart can't pump out the needed amount of blood.</li>
                        <li>If the main pumping chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, are stiff, they can't fill with enough blood between beats.</li>
                        <p>The heart muscle can be damaged by certain infections, heavy alcohol use, illegal drug use and some chemotherapy medicines. Your genes also can play a role.</p>
                        <p>Any of the following conditions also can damage or weaken the heart and cause heart failure:</p>
                        <li>  <span>Coronary artery disease and heart attack.</span> Coronary artery disease is the most common cause of heart failure. The disease results from the buildup of fatty deposits in the arteries. The deposits narrow the arteries. This reduces blood flow and can lead to heart attack. </li>
                        <li>  <span>High blood pressure.</span> Also called hypertension, this condition forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood through the body. Over time, the extra work can make the heart muscle too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood.</li>
                        <li>  <span>Heart valve disease. </span> The valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way. If a valve isn't working properly, the heart must work harder to pump blood. This can weaken the heart over time. Treating some types of heart valve problems may reverse heart failure.</li>
                        <li>  <span>Inflammation of the heart muscle, also called myocarditis. </span> Myocarditis is most commonly caused by a virus, including the COVID-19 virus, and can lead to left-sided heart failure.</li>
                        <li>  <span>A heart problem that you're born with, also called a congenital heart defect.</span> If the heart and its chambers or valves haven't formed correctly, the other parts of the heart have to work harder to pump blood. This may lead to heart failure.</li>
                        <li>  <span>Irregular heart rhythms, called arrhythmias.</span> Irregular heart rhythms may cause the heart to beat too fast, creating extra work for the heart. A slow heartbeat also may lead to heart failure. Treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people.</li>
                        <li>  <span>Other diseases.</span> Some long-term diseases may contribute to chronic heart failure. Examples are diabetes, HIV infection, an overactive or underactive thyroid, or a buildup of iron or protein.</li>

                        <h1> Diagnosis and Tests</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>How is heart failure diagnosed?</h2><br>
                        <p>To diagnose heart failure, your health care provider examines you and asks questions about your symptoms and medical history. Your provider checks to see if you have risk factors for heart failure, such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease or diabetes.</p>
                        <p>Your care provider listens to your lungs and heart with a device called a stethoscope. A whooshing sound called a murmur may be heard when listening to your heart. Your provider may look at the veins in your neck and check for swelling in your legs and belly.</p>
                        <p>Tests that may be done to diagnose heart failure may include:</p>
                        <li><span>Blood tests.</span> Blood tests can help diagnose diseases that can affect the heart. Blood tests also can look for a specific protein made by the heart and blood vessels. In heart failure, the level of this protein goes up.</li>
                        <li><span>Chest X-ray.</span> X-ray images can show the condition of the lungs and heart.</li>
                        <li><span>Electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG). </span> This quick and painless test records the electrical signals in the heart. It can show how fast or how slowly the heart is beating.</li>
                        <li><span>Echocardiogram. </span> Sound waves create images of the beating heart. This test shows the size and structure of the heart and heart valves and blood flow through the heart.</li>
                        <li><span>Ejection fraction.</span> Ejection fraction is a measurement of the percentage of blood leaving your heart each time it squeezes. This measurement is taken during an echocardiogram. The result helps classify heart failure and guides treatment. An ejection fraction of 50% or higher is considered ideal. But you can still have heart failure even if the number is considered ideal.</li>
                        <li><span>Exercise tests or stress tests.</span> These tests often involve walking on a treadmill or riding a stationary bike while the heart is monitored. Exercise tests can show how the heart responds to physical activity. If you can't exercise, you might be given medicines.</li>
                        <li><span>CT scan of the heart. </span> Also called a cardiac CT scan, this test uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the heart.</li>
                        <li><span>Heart MRI scan, also called a cardiac MRI.</span> This test uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the heart.</li>
                        <li><span>Coronary angiogram.</span> This test helps spot blockages in the heart arteries. The health care provider inserts a long, thin flexible tube called a catheter into a blood vessel, usually in the groin or wrist. It's then guided to the heart. Dye flows through the catheter to arteries in the heart. The dye helps the arteries show up more clearly on X-ray images and video.</li>
                        <li><span>Myocardial biopsy.</span> In this test, a health care provider removes very small pieces of the heart muscle for examination. This test may be done to diagnose certain types of heart muscle diseases that cause heart failure.</li>

                        <p>Treatment of heart failure may depend on the cause. Treatment often includes lifestyle changes and medicines. If another health condition is causing the heart to fail, treating it may reverse heart failure.</p>
                        <p>Some people with heart failure need surgery to open blocked arteries or to place a device to help the heart work better.With treatment, symptoms of heart failure may improve.</p>
                        <li>Medications</li>
                        <p>A combination of medicines may be used to treat heart failure. The specific medicines used depend on the cause of heart failure and the symptoms. Medicines to treat heart failure include:</p>
                        <li> <span>Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.</span> These drugs relax blood vessels to lower blood pressure, improve blood flow and decrease the strain on the heart. Examples include enalapril (Vasotec, Epaned), lisinopril (Zestril, Qbrelis) and captopril. </li>
                        <li> <span> Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). </span> These drugs have many of the same benefits as ACE inhibitors. They may be an option for people who can't tolerate ACE inhibitors. They include losartan (Cozaar), valsartan (Diovan) and candesartan (Atacand).</li>
                        <li> <span> Angiotensin receptor plus neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs). </span> This medicine uses two blood pressure drugs to treat heart failure. The combination medicine is sacubitril-valsartan (Entresto). It's used to treat some people with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. It may help prevent the need for a hospital stay in those people.</li>
                        <li> <span> Beta blockers.</span> These medicines slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. They reduce the symptoms of heart failure and help the heart work better. If you have heart failure, beta blockers may help you live longer. Examples include carvedilol (Coreg), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol-XL, Kapspargo Sprinkle) and bisoprolol.</li>
                        <li> <span> Diuretics.</span> Often called water pills, these medicines make you urinate more frequently. This helps prevent fluid buildup in your body. Diuretics, such as furosemide (Lasix, Furoscix), also decrease fluid in the lungs, so it's easier to breathe.</li>
                        <li> <span> Potassium-sparing diuretics.</span> Also called aldosterone antagonists, these drugs include spironolactone (Aldactone, Carospir) and eplerenone (Inspra). They may help people with severe heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) live longer.</li>
                        <li> <span> Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. </span> These medicines help lower blood sugar. They are often prescribed with diet and exercise to treat type 2 diabetes. But they're also one of the first treatments for heart failure. That's because several studies showed that the medicine lowered the risk of hospital stays and death in people with certain types of heart failure — even if they didn't have diabetes. These medicines include canagliflozin (Invokana), dapagliflozin (Farxiga), and empagliflozin (Jardiance).</li>
                        <li> <span> Digoxin (Lanoxin).</span> This drug, also called digitalis, helps the heart squeeze better to pump blood. It also tends to slow the heartbeat. Digoxin reduces heart failure symptoms in people with HFrEF. It may be more likely to be given to someone with a heart rhythm problem, such as atrial fibrillation.</li>
                        <li> <span> Hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate (BiDil). </span> This drug combination helps relax blood vessels. It may be added to your treatment plan if you have severe heart failure symptoms and ACE inhibitors or beta blockers haven't helped.</li>
                        <li> <span> Vericiguat (Verquvo).</span> This medicine for chronic heart failure is taken once a day by mouth. It's a type of drug called an oral soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator. In studies, people with high-risk heart failure who took this medicine had fewer hospital stays for heart failure and heart disease-related deaths compared with those who got a dummy pill.</li>
                        <li> <span> Positive inotropes.</span> These medicines may be given by IV to people with certain types of severe heart failure who are in the hospital. Positive inotropes can help the heart pump blood better and maintain blood pressure. Long-term use of these medicines has been linked to an increased risk of death in some people. Talk to your health care provider about the benefits and risks of these drugs.</li>

                        <h2>Can I prevent heart failure?</h2><br>
                        <p>One way to prevent heart failure is to treat and control the conditions that can cause it. These conditions include coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity.</p>
                        <p>Some of the same lifestyle changes used to manage heart failure also may help prevent it. Try these heart-healthy tips:</p>
                        <li> Don't smoke.</li>
                        <li> Get plenty of exercise.</li>
                        <li> Eat healthy foods.</li>
                        <li> Maintain a healthy weight.</li>
                        <li> Reduce and manage stress.</li>
                        <li> Take medicines as directed.</li>
