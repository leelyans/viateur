                    <h2> What is a heart attack?</h2><br>
                    <p>A heart attack (myocardial infarction) is an extremely dangerous condition that happens because you don’t have enough blood flow to some of your heart muscle. This lack of blood flow can occur because of many different factors but is usually related to a blockage in one or more of your heart’s arteries.</p>
                    <p>Without blood flow, the affected heart muscle will begin to die. If you don’t get blood flow back quickly, a heart attack can cause permanent heart damage and/or death.</p>
                    <p>A heart attack is a life-threatening emergency. If you think you or someone you’re with is having a heart attack, call 911 (or your local emergency services phone number). Time is critical in treating a heart attack. A delay of even a few minutes can result in permanent heart damage or death.</p>

                        <h2>What causes a heart attack?</h2><br>
                        <p>Most heart attacks happen because of a blockage in one of the blood vessels that supply your heart. Most often, this occurs because of plaque, a sticky substance that can build up on the insides of your arteries (similar to how pouring grease down your kitchen sink can clog your home plumbing). That buildup is called atherosclerosis. When there’s a large amount of this atherosclerotic buildup in the blood vessels to your heart, this is called coronary artery disease.</p>
                        <p>Sometimes, plaque deposits inside the coronary (heart) arteries can break open or rupture, and a blood clot can get stuck where the rupture happened. If the clot blocks the artery, this can deprive the heart muscle of blood and cause a heart attack.</p>
                        <!-- <p>Heart attacks are possible without ruptured plaque, but this is rare and only accounts for about 5% of all heart attacks. This kind of heart attack can occur for the following reasons:</p> -->
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Coronary artery spasm.</span> Back strains and sprains are the most common cause of back pain. You can injure muscles, tendons or ligaments by lifting something too heavy or not lifting safely. Some people strain their back by sneezing, coughing, twisting or bending over.</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Rare medical conditions, like any disease that causes unusual narrowing of blood vessels.</span>The bones in the spine can break during an accident, like a car crash or a fall. Certain conditions (such as spondylolysis or osteoporosis) increase the risk of fractures.</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Trauma that causes tears or ruptures in your coronary arteries. </span>Disks cushion the vertebrae (small spinal bones). Disks can bulge from their position in the spine and press on a nerve. They can also tear (herniated disk). With age, disks can get flatter and offer less protection (degenerative disk disease).</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Obstruction that came from somewhere else in your body, like a blood clot or air bubble (embolism) that ends up in a coronary artery.</span> A condition called spinal stenosis happens when the spinal column is too narrow for the spinal cord. Something pinching the spinal cord can cause severe sciatic nerve pain and lower back pain. Scoliosis (curvature of the spine) can lead to pain, stiffness and difficulty moving.</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Eating disorders.</span> Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis to cause lower back pain. Ankylosing spondylitis causes lower back pain, inflammation and stiffness in the spine.</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Anomalous coronary arteries (a heart issue you’re born with where the coronary arteries are in abnormal positions. Compression of these causes a heart attack).</span> Spine tumors, infections and several types of cancer can cause back pain. Other conditions can cause back pain, too. These include kidney stones and abdominal aortic aneurysm.</li>
                        <li> <span style="font-weight: bold; color: green; "> Other conditions that can cause your heart not to receive as much blood as it should for a prolonged period of time, such as when blood pressure is too low, oxygen is too low or your heart rate is too fast.</span> This condition causes the vertebrae in the spine to slip out of place. Spondylolisthesis leads to low back pain and often leg pain as well.</li>

                        <h1> Diagnosis and Tests</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>What tests will be done to diagnose a heart attack?</h2><br>
                        <p>A healthcare provider will diagnose a heart attack using the following:</p>
                        <li><span>Blood tests:</span> One of the most reliable ways to diagnose a heart attack is to check for cardiac troponin in your blood. During a heart attack, the damage to heart muscle cells always causes this chemical marker to appear in your bloodstream.</li>
                        <li><span>Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG):</span> This is one of the first tests you get when you come to an ER with heart attack symptoms. Your heart’s electrical signals can help tell if an injury is occurring as well as if there are any rhythm abnormalities.</li>
                        <li><span>Echocardiogram:</span> Using ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves), an echocardiogram generates a picture of the inside and outside of your heart. It can show how well your heart is squeezing and how well the valves are working.</li>
                        <li><span>Coronary angiogram or heart catheterization:</span> This is a procedure that uses X-rays and contrast dye to show the blood vessels to your heart and can help determine if there are any blockages.</li>
                        <li><span>Heart computed tomography (CT) scan:</span> This creates a highly detailed scan of your heart and its blood vessels to show if there’s any significant narrowing or hardening of the major coronary arteries.</li>
                        <li><span>Heart MRI (magnetic resonance imaging):</span> This test uses a powerful magnetic field and computer processing to create an image of your heart. It can show problems with the blood flow in the arteries to your heart.</li>
                        <li><span>Exercise stress test:</span> This test can use an ECG, echocardiogram or nuclear scans while you’re physically active to help show if your heart is receiving enough blood flow.</li>
                        <li><span>Nuclear heart scans:</span> These scans use a radioactive dye a provider injects into your blood and computer-enhanced methods like computed tomography (CT) to find areas of your heart that aren’t receiving as much blood or are injured. These scans can be single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans or positron emission tomography (PET) scans.</li>

                        <h1>Management and Treatment</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>How is a heart attack treated?</h2><br>
                        <p>Treating a heart attack means restoring blood flow to the affected heart muscle as soon as possible. This can happen in a variety of ways, ranging from medication to surgery. Treatment will likely include several of the following methods.</p>
                        <ul><span>Supplementary oxygen</span></ul>
                        <p>People having trouble breathing or with low blood oxygen levels often receive supplementary oxygen along with other heart attack treatments. You can breathe the oxygen either through a tube that sits just below your nose or a mask that fits over your nose and mouth. This increases the amount of oxygen circulating in your blood and reduces the strain on your heart.</p>
                        <ul><span>Medications</span></ul>
                        <p>These may include:</p>
                        <li> <span> Anti-clotting medications:</span> This includes aspirin and other blood-thinning medicines.</li>
                        <li> <span> Nitroglycerin:</span> This medicine relieves chest pain and causes blood vessels to widen</li>
                        <li> <span> Thrombolytic (clot-busting) medications:</span> Providers use these only within the first 12 hours after a heart attack.</li>
                        <li> <span> Anti-arrhythmia medications:</span> Heart attacks can often cause malfunctions in your heart’s normal beating rhythm called arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening. Anti-arrhythmia medications can stop or prevent these malfunctions.</li>
                        <li> <span> Pain medications:</span> The most common pain medication people receive during heart attack care is morphine. This can help alleviate chest pain.</li>

                        <h1>Prevention</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>Can a heart attack be prevented?</h2><br>
                        <p>In general, there are many things that you can do that may prevent a heart attack. However, there are some factors you can’t change — especially your family history — that can still lead to a heart attack despite your best efforts. Still, reducing your risk can postpone when you have a heart attack and reduce the severity if you have one.</p>
                        <h2>How can I lower my risk?</h2><br>
                        <p>Although several risk factors can’t be modified, there are many ways you can help yourself and reduce your risk of a heart attack. These include:</p>
                        <li> <span> Scheduling a checkup: </span>  Find a primary care provider (PCP) and see them at least once a year for a checkup or wellness visit. An annual checkup can catch many of the early warning signs of heart disease, including changes that you can’t feel. These include your blood pressure, blood sugar levels, cholesterol levels and more.</li>
                        <li> <span> Quitting tobacco products: </span>This includes smokeless tobacco and all vaping products.</li>
                        <li> <span> Exercising regularly: </span>Aim for 30 minutes of moderately intense physical activity five days a week.</li>
                        <li> <span> Eating nutritious foods:  </span>Examples include the Mediterranean or Dash diets. Eating plant-based meals is an excellent alternative to eating lots of processed meats and saturated fats.</li>
                        <li> <span> Maintaining a weight that’s healthy for you: </span>Your primary care provider can advise you on a healthy target weight and provide resources and guidance to help you reach that goal.</li>
                        <li> <span> Managing your existing health conditions: </span>This includes high cholesterol levels, high blood pressure and diabetes.</li>
                        <li> <span> Reducing your stress: </span>Consider techniques such as yoga, deep breathing and meditation.</li>
                        <li> <span> Taking your medications as prescribed: </span>Don’t just take medications when you remember to or when you have a doctor’s appointment coming up.</li>
                        <li> <span> Keeping all your medical appointments: </span>Seeing your healthcare providers regularly can help uncover heart-related issues or other medical problems you didn’t know you had. This can also help treat problems sooner rather than later.</li>

                        <h1>Outlook / Prognosis</h1><br><br>
                        <h2>Outlook for a heart attack</h2><br>
                        <p>Today, many people survive a heart attack. But the outlook is worse for people who:</p>
                        <li>Are over 65.</li>
                        <li>Have heart failure.</li>
                        <li>Have diabetes.</li>
                        <li>Already had a heart attack.</li>
                        <p>They may be at risk of another heart attack or of dying in the next six months or less. In these cases, providers will work to aggressively manage their risks.</p>
                        <p>Premenopausal people AFAB under age 45 have a better outcome than people AMAB of a similar age. Scientists believe this is because of estrogen’s heart-protective effects. But after menopause ends the protective benefits of estrogen, people AFAB fare worse than people AMAB. More specifically:</p>
                        <li>People AFAB between the ages of 45 and 65 who’ve had a heart attack are more likely to die within a year of the event compared with people AMAB of this same age.</li>
                        <li>People AFAB over age 65 are more likely to die within weeks of their heart attacks than people AMAB over age 65.</li>

                        <p>After you’ve had a heart attack, you’re at a higher risk of a similar occurrence. Your healthcare provider will likely recommend follow-up monitoring, testing and care to avoid future heart attacks. Some of these include:</p>
                        <li><span>Heart scans:</span> Like the methods providers use to diagnose a heart attack, these can assess the effects of your heart attack and determine if you have permanent heart damage. They can also look for signs of heart and circulatory problems that increase the chance of future heart attacks.</li>
                        <li><span>Stress test:</span> These heart tests and scans that take place while you’re exercising can show potential problems that stand out only when your heart is working harder.</li>
                        <li><span>Cardiac rehabilitation: </span> These programs help you improve your overall health and lifestyle, which can prevent another heart attack.</li>
